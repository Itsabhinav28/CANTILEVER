# **E-Commerce Website Project using Ant Design and React.js**

## **Project Description**

This repository contains the codebase for a **responsive e-commerce website** built using **React.js** with **Ant Design** for UI components. The project focuses on creating a sleek and user-friendly online shopping experience, incorporating various features commonly found in modern e-commerce platforms.

### **Key Features**:

- **App Header with Menu and Cart View**:
  - A dynamic and responsive header that includes a **navigation menu** allowing users to browse different categories and sections of the website.
  - A **"View Cart" button** that provides quick access to the shopping cart, displaying the number of items currently in the cart and allowing users to proceed to checkout.

- **App Footer with Static Links**:
  - A footer section that remains consistent across all pages, featuring **static links** to important pages such as **Contact Us, About Us, Privacy Policy**, and **Terms of Service**.
  - The footer is designed to be both aesthetically pleasing and functional, ensuring easy navigation for users at the bottom of each page.

- **App Routing with react-router-dom**:
  - Implementation of **client-side routing** using `react-router-dom` to allow smooth navigation between different pages without reloading the entire app.
  - Routes include **home, product categories, product details, cart**, and **checkout pages**, providing a seamless user experience.

- **API Integration for Data Fetching**:
  - Integration of **RESTful APIs** to fetch data from the server, including **product information, categories**, and **user data**.
  - The data is dynamically loaded and displayed in the app, ensuring that the product listings are always up-to-date with the latest information from the backend.

- **Product Listings with Detailed View and Actions**:
  - A **grid or list view** of e-commerce products, each represented by a card that includes the **product image, name, price**, and a brief description.
  - Each product card includes actions such as **"Add to Cart," "View Details,"** and **"Wishlist,"** allowing users to interact with products directly from the listing page.
  - **Detailed product pages** provide in-depth information, including **images, descriptions, specifications**, and **customer reviews**.

### **Technologies Used**:

- **React.js**: The core library for building the interactive and dynamic user interface of the app.
- **Ant Design**: A popular UI framework used to create a clean, modern, and responsive design for the e-commerce platform.
- **react-router-dom**: For managing client-side routing, enabling the single-page application experience.
- **Axios**: Used for making API requests to fetch data from the server.
- **CSS/SCSS**: Custom styles and responsive design tweaks to ensure the application looks great on all devices.

### **Project Objectives**:

- To build a functional e-commerce website that demonstrates the use of **React.js with Ant Design**.
- To practice integrating frontend applications with **backend APIs** for real-time data fetching.
- To understand the structure of a **modern React app**, including **routing, state management**, and **component architecture**.
- To create a user-friendly interface that is both visually appealing and highly functional on both **mobile and desktop devices**.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure the environment variables, including **API endpoints** for data fetching.
